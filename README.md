## This Repo

This repository contains code for building Universal Apps with SwiftUI. The same codebase can be compiled to produce
binaries that run natively in iOS, iPadOS and macOS, and take advantage of their respective user interfaces.  I have
built the UI using SwiftUI and taking into account the very important differences that those three platforms have.
I have tried to use several techniques in order to simplify code reuse and maintenance.
